# Root-Mean-Square Calculator

Calculates the Root-Mean-Square value over one period of the sine wave voltage

Sine function is used to mathematically model AC(alternating current) voltage. V amplitude describes how far the peak of the sine wave is above its center point. In the case of electricity, this center point is 0 Volt. We can include V amplitude in the sine expression using simple multiplication since the native sin(t) function cycles from +1 to -1.

RMS Voltage:

"Root-Mean-Square" technique is used to find a representative avarage number of a sine wave.The root of the mean of the square is taken. RMS value is a good approximation of the avarage magnitude of a sine wave.
