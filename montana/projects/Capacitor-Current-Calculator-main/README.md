# Capacitor Current Calculator

Capacitors:

The current through a capacitor is dependent on its capacitance and the rate fo change of the voltage across it.Capacitor's equation that describes it's current and voltage relationship is the following:

It is called the diffential equation because it depends on the rate of change of the independent variable and not simply its value.
