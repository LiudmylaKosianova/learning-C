In this task we had to:

- declare the rectangle structure 
- write a function rectangle canonicalize (takes a rectangle, and "fixes" its representation 
by ensuring that the width and height are non-negative ), 
- write a function rectangle intersection (which takes two rectangles (r1, and r2), and returns 
the rectangle representing the intersection of the two.)


The task is a part of a course: Writing, Running, and Fixing Code in C (offered on Coursera by Duke University)
