In the 80 years since the shocking collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington, 
engineers have designed suspended structures to minimize their universal weakness: resonance. 
If not designed to deal with oscillations caused by forces like wind, the frequency of 
these forces would cause tensions to build and inevitably break the structure.

When Jim Clair examined how to focus mirrors at a concentrated solar energy power plant, 
he thought about suspending the mirrors on cables but remembered the images 
of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge shaking itself apart. To determine how well these suspended 
solar panels would hold up to potentially destructive oscillations, Clair, and his 
company Skysun LLC in Cleveland, Ohio, sought the help of NASAâ€™s Glenn Research Center 
in 2016 to verify his design was safe from dangerous resonance.
